# Advent of Code 2024

https://adventofcode.com/2024

The plan is to do it in C++ this year.

Right now the solutions are definitely not optimal...

TODO:
- [ ] Finish all the challenges
- [ ] Benchmark the performance of calculating all the answers (in one go)
  - will require some work to run everything at once
  - Set the rules: e.g. each day's input in a separate file & just store the correct results as consts
- [ ] Work on improving the performance...
